[日本語](README.ja.md)

`Manaba Plus` is a browser extension that makes [manaba](https://manaba.jp/) a little more useful.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/manaba_plus)

## Install

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/manaba-downloader/aeidkdokanbhoefbgaadaicdmggdeegf?hl=ja)

## Feature

### Let me submit it right now!!

You can submit files in report pages with DnD.

You no longer need to select a file in the file selection dialog every time!!

### Oh~how inconsiderate you are...

Redirect from timeout pages to the home page.

You no longer need to get frustrated with SSO that does not return even when the session is timeout!!

### Well, who needs

Links jump into pages directly.

It has gone, the wasted step to press a link and another link!!

### Hey, where is it?

Download files in Course News, Assignments, and Resources.
Files will be sorted into folders by pages.

You no longer need to surf pages here and there to prepare materials!!

### Grades interest me

Bind grades to assignments.

You can jump from Grades to Assignments directly!!

### Hummmm, I'm getting worse and don't care what to do...

Show the assignment list at the top of the home page.
They are colored by remaining time to their deadlines.

Counting down rushes you!!

### Why do you enter my sight? Bother.

You can hide or move away Memos, Alerts, Announcements, Syllabus Search, Assignments, Old smartphone-optimized screens, Ads of Asahi Shimbun, and Banners.

For you, who like the simple style.

### Huh, you huh? Here?

You can hide assignments and courses you think are unnecessary.

"Unused Courses" disappear forever!!

### It's too slow

You can add and remove courses ⭐ without reloading the page.

You no longer need to reload every time pressing ⭐!!

### Every time and everywhere ♪

You can open the main panel from the toolbar icon.
The assignment list is in it.

You no longer need to visit manaba to check assignments!!

### Ops, dangerous

Show a message when some time has passed since the last downloading content.

You will not forget to download them.

### Only Tsukuba, right?

Adapt to [Many schools](host-list.md).

Your school should be adapted.

### Only Chrome, right?

Adapt to not only Chrome but also Edge and Firefox.

Just a moment, Safari users!!
